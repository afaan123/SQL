# SQL Learning Guide (Complete for Interviews)

## 1. Basics of SQL

### What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to interact with relational databases – to store, retrieve, and manipulate data.

---

### Basic SQL Syntax

```sql
-- Create a table
CREATE TABLE students (
  id INT,
  name VARCHAR(50),
  age INT
);

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO students (id, name, age)
VALUES
  (1, 'Alice', 20),
  (2, 'Bob', 22),
  (3, 'Charlie', 19);

-- Retrieve data
SELECT * FROM students;

-- Select specific columns
SELECT name, age FROM students;

-- Filter records
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age > 20;

-- Using AND / OR
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age > 18 AND name = 'Bob';

-- Sorting
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY age DESC;

-- Limit results
SELECT * FROM students LIMIT 2;

-- Update data
UPDATE students SET age = 23 WHERE name = 'Bob';

-- Delete data
DELETE FROM students WHERE id = 3;
```

---

## 2. Intermediate SQL

### DISTINCT, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE

```sql
-- Remove duplicates
SELECT DISTINCT age FROM students;

-- WHERE IN
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age IN (20, 22);

-- BETWEEN
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 22;

-- LIKE (Pattern Matching)
SELECT * FROM students WHERE name LIKE 'A%'; -- Starts with A
SELECT * FROM students WHERE name LIKE '%e'; -- Ends with e
```

---

### Aggregate Functions

```sql
-- COUNT
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students;

-- SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX
SELECT SUM(age) FROM students;
SELECT AVG(age) FROM students;
SELECT MIN(age), MAX(age) FROM students;
```

---

### GROUP BY and HAVING

```sql
-- Group and aggregate
SELECT age, COUNT(*) as count
FROM students
GROUP BY age;

-- HAVING (like WHERE but after GROUP BY)
SELECT age, COUNT(*) as count
FROM students
GROUP BY age
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

---

### JOINS

#### INNER JOIN

```sql
-- Tables
CREATE TABLE courses (
  student_id INT,
  course_name VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO courses VALUES
  (1, 'Math'),
  (2, 'Science'),
  (1, 'English');

-- Join students with courses
SELECT s.name, c.course_name
FROM students s
INNER JOIN courses c ON s.id = c.student_id;
```

#### LEFT JOIN

```sql
SELECT s.name, c.course_name
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN courses c ON s.id = c.student_id;
```

#### RIGHT JOIN *(not supported in SQLite)*

```sql
-- Syntax (works in MySQL/PostgreSQL)
SELECT s.name, c.course_name
FROM students s
RIGHT JOIN courses c ON s.id = c.student_id;
```

---

## 3. Advanced SQL

### Subqueries

```sql
-- Get students older than average age
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE age > (
  SELECT AVG(age) FROM students
);
```

---

### Common Table Expressions (CTE)

```sql
WITH adults AS (
  SELECT * FROM students WHERE age >= 18
)
SELECT * FROM adults;
```

---

### Window Functions

```sql
-- Add row numbers based on age
SELECT name, age,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY age DESC) AS row_num
FROM students;

-- RANK example
SELECT name, age,
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY age DESC) AS age_rank
FROM students;
```

---

### CASE Statement

```sql
SELECT name, age,
  CASE
    WHEN age < 20 THEN 'Teen'
    WHEN age BETWEEN 20 AND 22 THEN 'Young Adult'
    ELSE 'Adult'
  END AS category
FROM students;
```

## 1. More Basic SQL Queries

### IS NULL / IS NOT NULL

```sql
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age IS NULL;
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age IS NOT NULL;
````

---

### Aliasing

```sql
SELECT name AS student_name, age AS student_age FROM students;
```

---

### Mathematical Operations

```sql
SELECT name, age + 1 AS next_year_age FROM students;
```

---

## 2. More Intermediate SQL Queries

###  Nested Subqueries

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE age = (SELECT MAX(age) FROM students);
```

---

###  EXISTS

```sql
SELECT * FROM students s
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM courses c WHERE c.student_id = s.id
);
```

---

### DELETE with JOIN (MySQL)

```sql
DELETE s FROM students s
LEFT JOIN courses c ON s.id = c.student_id
WHERE c.student_id IS NULL;
```

---

## 3. More Advanced SQL Queries

### CTE with Aggregation

```sql
WITH avg_age_cte AS (
  SELECT AVG(age) AS avg_age FROM students
)
SELECT * FROM students, avg_age_cte
WHERE students.age > avg_age_cte.avg_age;
```

---

### Multiple Window Functions

```sql
SELECT name, age,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY age DESC) AS row_num,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY age DESC) AS age_rank,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY age DESC) AS dense_rank
FROM students;
```

---

###  LEAD / LAG (Window Navigation)

```sql
SELECT name, age,
  LEAD(age) OVER (ORDER BY age) AS next_age,
  LAG(age) OVER (ORDER BY age) AS previous_age
FROM students;
```

---

###  UNION / UNION ALL

```sql
SELECT name FROM students
UNION
SELECT course_name FROM courses;

SELECT name FROM students
UNION ALL
SELECT course_name FROM courses;
```

---

### CASE with GROUP BY

```sql
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN age < 20 THEN 'Teen'
    WHEN age BETWEEN 20 AND 22 THEN 'Young Adult'
    ELSE 'Adult'
  END AS age_group,
  COUNT(*) AS count
FROM students
GROUP BY age_group;
```
